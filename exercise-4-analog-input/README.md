# Analog Input



1. Given the circuit below. Compute the total resistance, total current and voltage drop across VR4R5, VR3, and VR1R2. Compare it against the voltage measured multimeters and using Arduino (TinkerCAD). Please show solution and screen shot the circuit which includes the multimeter’s readings and Arduino readings on both voltage drops and total current. Screen shots for the following
  a. VR4R5
  b. Σ VR4R5, VR3
  c. Σ VR4R5, VR3, VR1R2
