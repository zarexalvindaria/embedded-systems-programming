# 4 way Traffic Light

This project simulates a 4-way traffic light. The sequence of the traffic light, is as follows: first green lights up for 30 sec then turns off, upon green light turns off, yellow will light for 3 seconds then turns off, upon yellow light turns off, red will light up for 30 seconds and turns off. This cycle will be repeated. Both left and right traffic lights have the same sequence. This sequence is also applied to top and bottom traffic lights, except that when both left and right traffic green lights are lighted, top and bottom red lights should be lighted. When top and bottom green lights are lighted both red lights of left and right should be lighted.
